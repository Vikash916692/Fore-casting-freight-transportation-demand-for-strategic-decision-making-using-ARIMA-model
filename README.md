## 📌 Project Overview

Freight transportation demand is highly dynamic, influenced by seasonal trends, economic cycles, and external disruptions. Accurate forecasting enables businesses to improve capacity planning, streamline supply chains, and make informed decisions. This project applies ARIMA modeling to historical freight shipment data to generate reliable forecasts.


## 🔍 Objectives

• Analyze historical freight transportation data for patterns and trends.

• Build and tune an ARIMA time series model to predict future freight demand.

• Evaluate model performance using standard metrics like RMSE and MAPE.

• Provide visualizations and insights to aid strategic decision-making in logistics.


## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

• Pandas & NumPy

• Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

• Statsmodels (for ARIMA modeling)

• Jupyter Notebook
